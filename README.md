This repo is for the book [DevOps for the Desperate](https://nostarch.com/devops-desperate).

## Directories

Each one of these directories contain different material for different parts in the book.
Here is a quick overview of each directory:

* _ansible_: Contains the playbook and tasks to follow along in the first section of the book.

* _monitoring_: Contains the k8s manifest files to install Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana.

* _runbooks_: Contains a simple runbook for `telnet-server` and examples of a runbook broken up by alert. These are used in the alerts for Chapter 9.

* _telnet-server_: Contains the sample application that is used throughout two-thirds of the book.

* _vagrant_: Contains the Vagrantfile for the VM used in the first section of the book.

* _apple-silicon_: Contains the Vagrantfile for the VM used in the first section of the book and minikube instructions.
